Distributed ray-tracing

1) Run .exe.

2) Scene should automatically load with 1 plane and 2 spheres. Default is point light with hard shadow. The shaded image will also be saved to the ./images folder as ‘rasterized.png’.

3) The light position can be updated by clicking around the screen. UP, DOWN, RIGHT, & LEFT arrows can be used to pivot camera up, down, right & left, respectively, ALT & CTRL to zoom in & out.

‘P’ = glossy
‘Z’ = transluscent
‘V’ = depth of field/out of focus
‘I’ = motion blur

Only the latest image will be saved.

Disclaimer: This will still be hella slow.
