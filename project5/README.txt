1) Run .exe.

2) Scene should automatically load with 3 planes & 1 sphere. The shaded image will also be saved to the ./images folder as ‘rasterized.png’.

3) The light position can be updated by clicking around the screen. UP, DOWN, RIGHT, & LEFT arrows can be used to pivot camera up, down, right & left, respectively, ALT & CTRL to zoom in & out.  Only the latest image will be saved.

4) Specular highlight shape can be toggled using SHIFT (the light plane is parallel to the z-axis, so the spec gets really thin if the light position is moved too far off to the side).
