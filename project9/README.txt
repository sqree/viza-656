1) Run .exe.
Note: Majority of added .obj support is in the geometry class (triangle) and first half of the draw function (prior to shadow casting).

2) Scene should automatically load with 1 plane, 1 cubes, and 2 spheres. Default is point light with hard shadow. The shaded image will also be saved to the ./images folder as ‘rasterized.png’.

3) The light position can be updated by clicking around the screen. UP, DOWN, RIGHT, & LEFT arrows can be used to pivot camera up, down, right & left, respectively, ALT & CTRL to zoom in & out.

‘P’ = refraction
‘Z’ = reflection
’N’ = reflection defined by normal texture
‘V’ = environment map
‘I’ = iridescence (sort of)
‘Y’ = IOR defined by texture

Only the latest image will be saved.

Disclaimer: This will be hella slow.
